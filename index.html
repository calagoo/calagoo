        Hello, I am Robert Rodriguez. I graduated in December of 2022 from
        Arizona State University and started working shortly after. I figured
        out my passion towards the end of high school, I knew I wanted to be
        involved in the aerospace engineering industry. <br /><br />
        I have always loved cars and racing, especially Formula 1, so I thought
        going into a field closely related to aerodynamics would be fun. Over
        the course of my education I found out that I enjoy just about all parts
        of aerospace engineering, including flight planning flight testing,
        aerodynamics, and orbits/geodesy. <br /><br />
        After starting work I became much more interested in geodesy and GNSS in
        general. This new passion ignited some other interests, such as coding
        and data analysis. I had coded using MATLAB throughout college, but once
        I started using Python my skills greatly improved.<br /><br />
        Some other hobbies I have include working on my motorcycle in my free
        time, designing and printing CAD parts using SOLIDWORKS, and I also love
        snowboarding, mountain biking and rock climbing (bouldering).<br /><br />
        I have added these small simulations to showcase my coding and
        interests. As a disclaimer, I don't have much experience with
        Javascript, and these are my first tries with it. Also this website is
        always a work in progress.

            Note: Due to the larger timestep, the orbit undergoes slight apsidal
            precession.This is why some orbital elements that should stay
            constant in these conditions fluctuate.
