      Hello, I am Robert Rodriguez. I graduated in December of 2022 from Arizona
      State University and started working shortly after. I figured out my
      passion towards the end of high school, I knew I wanted to be involved in
      the aerospace engineering industry. <br />
      I have always loved cars and racing, especially Formula 1, so I thought
      going into a field closely related to aerodynamics would be fun. Over the
      course of my education I found out that I enjoy just about all parts of
      aerospace engineering, including flight planning flight testing,
      aerodynamics, and orbits/geodesy. <br />
      After starting work I became much more interested in geodesy and GNSS in
      general. This new passion ignited some other interests, such as coding and
      data analysis. I had coded using MATLAB throughout college, but once I
      started using Python my skills greatly improved.<br />
      Some other hobbies I have include working on my motorcycle in my free
      time, designing and printing CAD parts using SOLIDWORKS, and I also love
      snowboarding, mountain biking and rock climbing (bouldering).<br />
      I have added these small simulations to showcase my coding and interests.
      As a disclaimer, I don't have much experience with Javascript, and these
      are my first tries with it. Also this website is always a work in
      progress.

          Note: Due to the larger timestep, the orbit undergoes slight apsidal
          precession.This is why some orbital elements that should stay constant
          in these conditions fluctuate.
