        Hello, I am Robert Rodriguez. I graduated in December of 2022 from
        Arizona State University and started working shortly after. I figured
        out my passion towards the end of high school, I knew I wanted to be
        involved in the aerospace engineering industry. <br /><br />
        I have always loved cars and racing, especially Formula 1, so I thought
        going into a field closely related to aerodynamics would be fun. Over
        the course of my education I found out that I enjoy just about all parts
        of aerospace engineering, including flight planning flight testing,
        aerodynamics, and orbits/geodesy. <br /><br />
        After starting work I became much more interested in geodesy and GNSS in
        general. This new passion ignited some other interests, such as coding
        and data analysis. I had coded using MATLAB throughout college, but once
        I started using Python my skills greatly improved.<br /><br />
        Some other hobbies I have include working on my motorcycle in my free
        time, designing and printing CAD parts using SOLIDWORKS, and I also love
        snowboarding, mountain biking and rock climbing (bouldering).<br /><br />

    <div id="Simulations" class="tabcontent">
      <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
        I have added these small simulations to showcase my coding and
        interests. As a disclaimer, I don't have much experience with
        Javascript, and these are my first tries with it. I have always loved
        games that are scientifically based, such as Kerbal Space Program or
        Universe Sandbox. Although I have tried, solo game dev is not for me,
        but I have come to realize I love putting together small simulations
        such as the ones below. Visualizing how physics interact I think is
        amazing, and it helps me stay sharp on math from university.<br /><br />
        Also of course this entire website is always a work in progress. Please
        feel free and take a look at the source code on github to see how I
        created these little sims.

            <h3>Orbiter</h3>
            This is my orbiter simulation. This simulation uses data from the
            Earth and the Sun in order to accurately model orbits.
            <br /><br />To model the gravitation forces, Newtons universal law
            of gravitation is used. This is then converted to acceleration from
            the planets mass, and then converted further into velocity and
            position.<br /><br />The gravity force angle is calculated through a
            arctangent function, Math.atan2().<br /><br />The distance is simply
            the magnitude of the x and y position relative to the sun, and the
            orbital speed is found using the orbital speed equation with values
            G, Mass-sun, distance and semi-major axis.<br /><br />
            The semi-major axis is found using the specific orbital energy
            equation.<br /><br />
            Eccentricity is found by first finding the eccentricity vector and
            then taking the magnitude of it.<br /><br />
            Finally, apoapsis and periapsis are easily found by using the
            semi-major axis and the eccentrity.

            NOTE: The reason some items fluctuate (such as period, or
            eccentricity) is because of the larger timestep. The smaller the
            timestep, the more accurate the values become.

            <h3>Flight Control</h3>
            This simulation takes values of a Boeing 737 (including mass, CL,
            CD, thrust, and more) and inputs it into a PID controller to keep it
            both level on the target height, and in the X-center of the
            window.<br /><br />
            The coefficient of lift and drag are found by taking values from
            airfoiltools.com, they are then linearly interpolated using the
            angle of attack. The lift is found by using the lift equation and
            plugging in the density of air, the velocity of the aircraft and the
            aircrafts wing reference area (sref).<br /><br />
            In the case of this simulation we are taking the density of air to
            be near sea-level at 1.225 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and velocity is 200
            m/s. The SREF of the Boeing 737 is about 125 m<sup>2</sup>.<br /><br />
            This simulation also features procedurally generated clouds. Each
            cloud is created out of a random number of "lobes", and each lobe is
            placed randomly around the cloud. The further out a lobe, the more
            transparent it becomes. I felt like this gave the clouds a neat
            digital look. Currently there is a 75% chance to spawn a cloud per
            tick. I implemented a cloud slider in case they get distracting.
