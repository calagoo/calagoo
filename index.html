          &emsp; Hello, I am Robert Rodriguez. I graduated in December 2022 from Arizona State University with a
          bachelor's
          in
          aeronautical engineering and started working shortly after. I have been interested in mechanical objects since
          I
          was very young. I figured out my aerospace-related passions towards the end of high school due to some physics
          classes I took. I am thankful our high school had a 3D design class as an elective; this is where I first used
          SOLIDWORKS, followed shortly after by SOLIDWORKS flow simulation.<br>&emsp; Seeing the fluids being simulated
          and
          being able
          to cut a cross-section of the flow, I think it is so interesting to see how fluids move throughout their
          constraints. Starting with cubes and pipes and seeing how air and water would interact over and in those
          objects,
          I then moved to more advanced objects such as relatively simple airfoils and vehicle profiles. At this point,
          I
          was learning almost all of my SOLIDWORKS at home on a student account with a computer that wasn't happy about
          all
          of this new CPU stress. <br><br>
          &emsp; I have always loved cars and racing, especially Formula 1, so I thought going into a field closely
          related
          to
          aerodynamics would be fun. I figured that if I combined my love for cars and aircraft, I would have no problem
          pursuing aerospace engineering. Over the course of my education, I found out that I enjoy more than just
          aerodynamics but just about all parts of aerospace engineering, including flight planning, flight testing,
          orbits,
          and geodesy.

          &emsp; My capstone project was really engaging and entertaining because I really enjoyed what
          I
          was doing. The project involved
          designing and simulating a space tourism aircraft capable of taking off and landing on a runway and being able
          to
          make it above 300,000 feet. This project was a lot of fun. I was involved in most aspects of the design as our
          team lead, but I single-handedly took on the flight testing and flight simulations of our proposed aircraft.
          Using
          hundreds of different parameters, our final aircraft was able to sustain greater than 60 seconds above 300k
          feet
          and was capable of taking 14 passengers on each trip. Each climb would approach Mach 3.4, and I had to
          simulate
          different reentry angles to maintain relatively low stagnation temperatures. <br><br>
          &emsp; After beginning working, I was involved with a testing team as an intern. I was involved with testing
          different GNSS receivers, and this caught my interest. I started learning Python to code in order to do data
          analysis on the GNSS data. First, by scraping GGA messages, which are simple positioning messages that consist
          of
          latitude, longitude, altitude, and a few other details. I became very involved in coding and data analysis. I
          had
          coded using MATLAB throughout college, but once I started at this company, my skills greatly improved, so much
          so
          that a few months after starting my internship, I became a Test Automation Engineer, where I am currently.
          This
          position involved trying to automate the testing procedures as much as possible. This work helped me become
          much
          more interested in geodesy and GNSS in general.<br><br>
          &emsp; Some other hobbies I have include working on my motorcycle in my free
          time, designing and printing CAD parts, and I also love
          snowboarding, mountain biking and rock climbing (bouldering). Anything really to get the blood pumping, and
          being outdoors while doing it is a plus.<br><br>

    <h2>Simulations</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;">
      I have added these small simulations to showcase my coding and
      interests. As a disclaimer, I don't have much experience with
      Javascript, and these are my first tries with it. I have always loved
      games that are scientifically based, such as Kerbal Space Program or
      Universe Sandbox. Although I have tried, solo game dev is not for me,
      but I have come to realize I love putting together small simulations
      such as the ones below. Visualizing how physics interact I think is
      amazing, and it helps me stay sharp on math from university as well as learning new concepts and most importantly,
      how to implement it into code.<br><br>
      Also of course this entire website is always a work in progress. Please
      feel free and take a look at the source code on github to see how I
      created these little sims.

          This is my orbiter simulation. This simulation uses data from the
          Earth and the Sun in order to accurately model orbits. To model the gravitation forces, Newtons universal law
          of gravitation is used. This is then converted to acceleration from
          the planets mass, and then converted further into velocity and
          position.<br><br>The gravity force angle is calculated through a
          arctangent function, Math.atan2().<br><br>The distance is simply
          the magnitude of the x and y position relative to the sun, and the
          orbital speed is found using the orbital speed equation with values
          G, Mass-sun, distance and semi-major axis.<br><br>
          The semi-major axis is found using the specific orbital energy
          equation.<br><br>
          Eccentricity is found by first finding the eccentricity vector and
          then taking the magnitude of it.<br><br>
          Finally, apoapsis and periapsis are easily found by using the
          semi-major axis and the eccentrity.

          NOTE: The reason some items fluctuate (such as period, or
          eccentricity) is because of the larger timestep. The smaller the
          timestep, the more accurate the values become.

          This simulation takes values of a Boeing 737 (including mass, CL,
          CD, thrust, and more) and inputs it into a PID controller to keep it
          both level on the target height, and in the X-center of the
          window.<br><br>
          The coefficient of lift and drag are found by taking values from
          airfoiltools.com, they are then linearly interpolated using the
          angle of attack. The lift is found by using the lift equation and
          plugging in the density of air, the velocity of the aircraft and the
          aircrafts wing reference area (sref).<br><br>
          In the case of this simulation we are taking the density of air to
          be near sea-level at 1.225 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and velocity is 200
          m/s. The SREF of the Boeing 737 is about 125 m<sup>2</sup>.<br><br>
          This simulation also features procedurally generated clouds. Each
          cloud is created out of a random number of "lobes", and each lobe is
          placed randomly around the cloud. The further out a lobe, the more
          transparent it becomes. I felt like this gave the clouds a neat
          digital look. Currently there is a 75% chance to spawn a cloud per
          tick. I implemented a cloud slider in case they get distracting.

      on this page. It could range
      from just an empty canvas to a 99% complete sim. Currently, this is showing colliding balls, my attempt at a
      simple physics system. As of 3/16/23, it is 80% complete, with all of the math finalized. The next step for this
      project is figuring out how to implement an interactive feature to it.
