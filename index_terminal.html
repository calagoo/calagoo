        <div id="divAboutme">
            <p>Hello, I'm Robert Rodriguez, an Aerospace Engineer with a Bachelor's from Arizona State University, class of December 2022. My journey into engineering began in high school, fueled by a fascination for mechanical objects and a love for physics and 3D design. Early exposure to SOLIDWORKS and flow simulation ignited my passion for aerodynamics, leading me to explore the dynamics of air and water across various objects.</p>
            <p>My affinity for cars and racing, particularly Formula 1, steered me towards aerospace engineeringâ€”a field where my interests in aerodynamics, flight planning, and testing converge. Throughout my education, I found joy in the diverse aspects of aerospace, from orbits to geodesy.</p>
            <p>The highlight of my academic career was my capstone project, where I led the design and simulation of a space tourism aircraft, achieving sustained flight above 300,000 feet with 14 passengers. This project not only honed my leadership skills but also deepened my expertise in flight testing and simulations.</p>
            <p>Professionally, I began as an intern in GNSS receiver testing, where my intrigue for data analysis led me to Python. This skill advancement transitioned me into a Test Automation Engineer role, focusing on optimizing testing procedures and enhancing my understanding of geodesy and GNSS.</p>
            <p>Beyond engineering, my passions extend to motorcycles, CAD designing, and outdoor adventures like snowboarding and rock climbing, embodying my love for adrenaline and nature.</p>
